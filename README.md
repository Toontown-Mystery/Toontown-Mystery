# Source Code
This source code is based on a March 2019 fork of Toontown Offline v1.0.0.0. It has been stripped of all Toontown Offline exclusive features, save one. The brand new Magic Words system made for Toontown Offline has been left alone, and upgraded to the most recent build. This feature will allow users to easily navigate around Toontown without any hassle.
