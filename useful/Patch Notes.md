* Nerfed the max laff from the beginning to the finish. 500 > 240

HOLD UP! Why are you changing the max laff? Well, that's because the cogs have gotten another revamp of balance thanks to their boss managers being too cruel to the Toons.

Aoogah = 60 > 30
Trunk = 90 > 45
Fog = 150 > 75

* Since Throw and Squirt are typically the normal 2 damage gags, they both now do the same damage.

Level 1 = 6 damage.
Level 2 = 15 damage.
Level 3 = 35 damage.
Level 4 = 60 damage.
Level 5 = 100 damage.

300 > 40
400 > 80
500 > 140
200

* And finally, happy to introduce... cogs also have gotten a rebalance too. Instead of cogs following a formula, they follow their own formula based off tier ranks.

Toontown Mystery 3.2.6

* Fixed crashes related to the bosses. (districts may still reset on fashionboss and boss cog officer, just simply go in the bosses multiple times, but the final 2 should work fine without issues)
