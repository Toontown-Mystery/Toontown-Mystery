Toonup = Heal amount max is based on the max hp in the game in a percentage, so hopefully every level gets an equal percentage. (yes there will still be a single number, but like say the max hp is 500, and lipstick does 300, that's 60% max hp)

Toontown Mystery: Update 3.2.5

Updated Merry Go Round and Pirate's Boat Lagoon Playground textures as part of a recreation.
Nerfed the max laff from the beginning to the finish. 500 > 240

HOLD UP! Why are you changing the max laff? Well, that's because the cogs have gotten another revamp of balance thanks to their boss managers being too cruel to the Toons.

Gag damage bonus has been nerfed from 100% to the updated numbers. 2 toons = 100 > 40 - 3 Toons = 100 > 60 - 4 Toons = 100 > 75.

New experience levels have these as numbers. 0, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000.

Gags once again have been balanced.

Toonup has gotten nerfed again, making sure it matches certain percentages with laff.

Feather = 125 > 60
Megaphone = 300 > 150
Lipstick = 275 > 144
Bamboo Cane = 600 > 288
Pixie Dust = 375 > 180
Juggling Cubes = 900 > 432
High Dive = 1200 > 648

Trap has been nerfed, slightly...

Banana Peel = 270 > 200
Rake = 540 > 265
Marbles = 835 > 348
Quicksand = 1100 > 487
Trapdoor = 1500 > 638
TNT = 1800 > 800
Train = 2000 > 1100

Lure knockback has been decreased from 75% to 15%.

Sound has been slightly nerfed by 50%.

Bike Horn = 14 > 7
Whistle = 25 > 13
Bugle = 40 > 20
Aoogah = 60 > 30
Trunk = 90 > 45
Fog = 150 > 75
Opera = 200 > 100

Since Throw and Squirt are typically the normal 2 damage gags, they both now do the same damage.

Level 1 = 6 damage.
Level 2 = 15 damage.
Level 3 = 35 damage.
Level 4 = 60 damage.
Level 5 = 100 damage.
Level 6 = 150 damage.
Level 7 = 170 damage.

Drop has gotten a nerf to sort of match the throw and squirt.

Flower Pot = 50 > 10
Sandbag = 85 > 20
Anvil = 160 > 40
Big Weight = 250 > 85
Safe = 350 > 130
Piano = 500 > 190
Toontanic = 600 > 210

Gag carry amounts also have been changed to where you can carry less gags in the pouch.

Level 1s = 20
Level 2s = 15
Level 3s = 10
Level 4s = 7
Level 5s = 5
Level 6s = 2
Level 7s = 1

Group lures have it's own separate carry amount to reflect the change to it.

Level 2s = 20
Level 4s = 15
Level 6s = 5

Unites have been given less HP due to the max hp limitations, but have been given 1 increased unite.

300 > 40
400 > 80
500 > 140
200

And finally, happy to introduce... cogs also have gotten a rebalance too. Instead of cogs following a formula, they follow their own formula based off tier ranks.
